# Remtest -- memorize dates & words easily
> **WARNING**: this project is not production-ready, only for educational purposes

## Introduction
This project is developed during my studying at university. So, nothing important there -- for educational purposes only :)
The goal of the project to provide a platform that helps you to memorize dates & words, etc.

## Modules & terms
1. **Pack** -- a set of question & answer pairs.
2. **Server** -- a hosted module used to manage & store packs.
3. **Client** -- an HTTP service used to search, show and run packs.

## Running a pack
A client side downloads and runs a pack -- it generates a list of questions with 4 answer each one (1 right answer + 3 random answers taking from pack).

The more often a user makes a mistake on a question, the more often this question arises.

## Powerpoint presentation
It describes the task and limitations of the project as well as architecture of that.
